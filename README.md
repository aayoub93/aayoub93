# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ahmed

<img src="https://github.com/aayoub93/aayoub93/blob/main/github_header.png">

I am a UX/UI and product designer with experience in user research, ideation, prototyping and visual design. I take pride in crafting good looking and intuitive user experiences by iterative testing and design. I went through Bloc to gain these skills and worked with senior designers/mentors to cultivate and apply these skills to multiple projects. One such project that I took from start to finish is [Pencrumbs](https://ahmedayoub.design/pencrumbs.html), a service that connects readers and writers to all things poetry-related. I draw on my past experiences in technical roles, first to empathize with folks, and second to marry my technical background with my love for creativity. This is what led me into the design field. :blush:
